<p>This is a re-creation of the classic NES game Metroid.</p>
<p>Press 4 to be taken to the custom level.</p>
<p>This level offers a brief introduction to the new mimic mode mechanic for both the Zoomer and the Skree. The player must traverse with their new movement types through spikes and blockades to reach the goal.</p>
<p>The Zoomer movement is a little jank near corners, so be careful.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy</p>

<p>My partner dropped out for this project, so it's not quite to the level that I'd hoped it would be.</p>
